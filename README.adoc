# parzer

Zig's standard library supplies a json serializer/deserializer but other formats such as toml, xml
and so on don't get such a treatment. Furthermore the json module is not easily configurable to
accomodate different ways to represent structured data such as serde.rs's internally tagged enum's.
Parzer aims to make it much easier to work with these slightly different formats, by allowing programatic
generation of serializers/deserializers. It also aims to be able to work with different formats than json.
